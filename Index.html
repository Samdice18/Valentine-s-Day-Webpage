      <h1>A Question From My Heart 💜</h1>

      <p class="message">
        From the very beginning, there was something different about you.
        Something calm. Something warm. Something that made things feel right
        even when nothing else was.
        <br><br>
        
        Over time, I started noticing the little things, the way you laugh,
        the way you listen, the way you make ordinary moments feel special
        without even trying.
        You don’t just exist in my life, you add meaning to it.
        <br><br>
        
        I’ve realized that love doesn’t always have to be loud or perfect.
        Sometimes it’s quiet, steady, and comforting.
        Sometimes it’s simply knowing that someone makes your days lighter
        just by being there.
        <br><br>
        
        In Xitsonga we say,
        <br>
        <strong>“Rirhandzu i ku rhandza hi mbilu hinkwayo.”</strong>
        <br>
        Love is choosing someone with your whole heart.
        <br><br>
        
        And honestly, that’s how I feel about you.
        Not rushed. Not forced. Just real.
        Every day I appreciate you more, and every day I’m grateful
        that our paths crossed.
        <br><br>
        
        So I made this page because I wanted this moment to feel special,
        something you could take your time reading,
        something you could scroll through and feel.
        <br><br>
        
        With Valentine’s Day getting closer, I thought it was the perfect time
        to ask you something meaningful, something simple, but full of heart.
        <br><br>
        
        No pressure. No expectations.
        Just a question coming from a place of care, respect, and love.
        <br><br>
        
        Will you be my Valentine? 💜
